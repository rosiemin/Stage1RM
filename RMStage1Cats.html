                So anyone could tell you the number one way to really procrastinate is to start browsing <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> and see
                what deep dark hole of the site you can find. The purpose of this page? Well I'm going to show you some of my favorite past times on
                YouTube and give you a bit more context into why they are good starting points to lead you to hours of <b>glorious</b> procrastination.

                  <span class="letter">A</span>s a cat owner myself, I find all cat videos quite hilarious. Does this make me a <b>slight</b> crazy cat person? I think so, but I really
                  do try to play it off like it's nothing. I mean come on, cats and cucumbers? Who doesn't like something like this? This is just the beginning
                  of any crazy cat videos that will keep you entertained for hours to come.

                  videos out there, at least in my opinion. I have spent hours upon hours watching the ridiculous <em>s**t</em> that these guys do and really it just
                  leads to me click on more of their videos and before I know it, it's <em>5:00pm</em> and I should be getting on the subway to go home. Needless to say, these videos always make for
                  a <u>great</u> time for procrastinating.

                  <span class="letter">L</span>ast, but certainly not least, I highly recommend any of the late-night shows. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/latenight">Jimmy Fallon</a>,
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SaturdayNightLive">SNL</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight">John Oliver</a> or
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtFAi84ehTSYSE9XoHefig">Stephen Colbert</a> are all good places to start. Everytime I end up loading one of these shows, I spend hours
                  watching lip-sync battles, actual singing battles, random sketches from some pretty hilarious people, or just getting very frustrated about how all the news nowadays is Trump.
                  Either way, it definitely allows for hours of (<em>hopefuly</em>) fun procrasstination.

                If all else fails you, then I'd just suggest putting on <a href="www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>, and start to binge watch anything on there. I am only <em>slightly</em> obessed with
                30 Rock, but to each their own.
