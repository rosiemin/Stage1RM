                    The first thing you might be asking yourself is... "Is that a plush testicle?" Well really it probably wasn't the first thing you
                    were asking yourself, but the answer to that question is. <b>Yes, yes it is.</b> Now you might be asking yourself, "Why did I come
                    to this website of this crazy person holding a plush testicle?" For that, I have no answer, but I can let you know it all has relevance
                    to who I am and what I research.

                    I orignally come from the glorious land of the Pacific Northwest (<em>west coast, best coast?</em>) and now currently reside in that
                    city where all of those people walk really really fast and have to be somewhere at all times. Yup, you guessed it, good 'ol NYC.
                    I am currently a doctoral student getting a degree in public health. Ahh that over-used broad statement that can mean so many different
                    and wonderful things. Most people just ask me what public health is, and to any different public health professional, they will give
                    you a different answer. I'll give you mine. Public health is a field in which multiple disciplines come together to try to better
                    the health of the people. These disciplines include, but are not limited to:

                    I tend to put myself in that third public health category, <b>Environmental Health</b>. So what do all of those words that are on that screen
                    have to do with environmental health? Well, long story short, I have the pleasure of studying how environmental exposures
                    (<em>phthalates</em>) impact <b>male infertility</b> by way of examining the molecular pathways. In particular, I focus on <u>mitochondria</u>,
                    the powerhouse of all our cells. It's actually quite interesting and important in this day and age, but really I have the privledge of working
                    with <em>sperm</em> all day 'er day.

                    Last, but certainly not least, I have to introduce my two feline friends who are constant companions and rely heavily on my non-existant income
                    for food. Chloe (left) I adopted about 4 years ago from the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> in New York. Piper (right) on the other hand, I ended
                    up adopting her about 2 years ago from the <a href="https://www.mspca.org/">MSPCA</a> during my short stint in Boston. They are an integral part
                    of who I am, so I'd be selling you short if you didn't get to see at least one adorable picture of each of them.
